## üöÄ Ready to Use
This project currently runs only on Windows systems.

You can directly download and use the Windows installer of this project from [Releases](https://github.com/LinyuJupiter/screenshot2code/releases), install and use it according to the installer without configuring any dependencies.

Alternatively, you can download Screenshot2code.7z from [Releases](https://github.com/LinyuJupiter/screenshot2code/releases) and extract it. Double-click on /Screenshot2code/Screenshot2code.exe to run it without configuring any dependencies.

## üõ† Local Setup

This project is a front-end and back-end separated project. The front-end is a graphical interface running on Windows system built using PyQt5, and the back-end is a service written in FastAPI that can run on Windows system or Linux server.

To run this project, you need to install Python 3.8 or higher version. First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinYujupiter/screenshot2code.git
cd screenshot2code
```

### 1. Environment Setup

#### ¬∑ Using Conda

If you are using Conda, you can set up and activate a virtual environment by following these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n screenshot2code python=3.8
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   conda activate screenshot2code
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   While the virtual environment is activated, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### ¬∑ Without Conda

If you are not using Conda, you can directly install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Backend Service

After installing all dependencies, you can start the backend service with the following command:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7001

# Alternatively, use the following command
python3 start.py
```

On a Linux server, you can also start or stop the backend service with the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
sh run.sh  # Start the service
sh stop.sh # Stop the service
```

On a Windows system, you can also start or stop the backend service with the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
run.bat  # Start the service
stop.bat   # Stop the service

# Alternatively, use the following command
python3 start.py
```

On a Windows system, you can also download backend.7z from [Releases](https://github.com/LinyuJupiter/screenshot2code/releases) and extract it. Double-click on /backend/backend.exe to run it without configuring any dependencies.

### 3. Run the Frontend Interface

The frontend program can only run on Windows system. After installing all dependencies, you can start the frontend program with the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 main.py
```

You can also download frontend.7z from [Releases](https://github.com/LinyuJupiter/screenshot2code/releases) and extract it. Double-click on /frontend/frontend.exe to run it without configuring any dependencies.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQs

- **What is the logic behind code generation?** - This program first sends the screenshot to the GLM-4v model to generate image descriptions, then sends the generated descriptions to the GLM-4 model to generate code, and finally sends the alt descriptions of the images in the generated code to the cogview-3 model to generate images.
- **Why is my generated code different from the expected result?** - Please check if your screenshot is clear and make sure it contains enough information to generate the correct code. If your screenshot still cannot generate the correct code, try taking a new screenshot or contacting me.
- **How can I obtain the API key for zhipu?** - Please go to the [Zhipu Developer Platform](https://maas.aminer.cn/usercenter/apikeys) to obtain it.
- **How to configure environment variables for the backend server?** - Please modify the corresponding variables in config.json when running the backend service.
- **How can I provide feedback?** - You can submit issues or suggestions in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LinYujupiter/screenshot2code/issues). You can also contact me through the contact information on [my homepage](https://github.com/LinYujupiter).
