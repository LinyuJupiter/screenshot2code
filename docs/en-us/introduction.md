# Project Overview

## 1. Project Background and Objectives
   - Background: In the current frontend development process, developers often need to convert design drafts or screenshots into HTML + CSS code in order to quickly build webpage prototypes. However, this process typically relies on manual operation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to solve this problem by automatically converting screenshots into frontend webpage code, thereby improving development efficiency.
   - Objectives: Build software that can automatically convert screenshots into HTML + Tailwind CSS code, reducing the workload for frontend developers during the design draft conversion process.

## 2. Project Scope
   - Functionality: The main functions of the software include screenshot uploading, description generation from screenshots, and HTML + Tailwind CSS code generation.
   - Business Domain: The software is suitable for frontend development, web design, and related fields.

## 3. Project Team and Responsibilities
   - Project Manager: Responsible for overall project progress and resource coordination.
   - Frontend Development: Build software interface using PyQT5 and implement interaction with users.
   - Backend Development: Build server using FastAPI, handle logic for screenshot uploading, description generation, and code generation.

## 4. Project Schedule and Milestones
   - Requirements Analysis and Design: 1 week
   - Frontend Interface Development: 2 weeks
   - Backend API Development: 2 weeks
   - System Integration and Testing: 1 week
   - Project Acceptance and Delivery: 1 week

## 5. Technology Selection and Architecture
   - Frontend: Use PyQT5 to build a cross-platform desktop application interface.
   - Backend: Use FastAPI to build Websocket API for data interaction with frontend interface.
   - GLM-4v Vision Multimodal Large Language Model: Used for generating screenshot description text.
   - GLM-4 Long Text Large Language Model: Used for generating HTML + Tailwind code.

## 6. Project Risks and Mitigation Measures
   - Poor Model Performance: Attempt to optimize model parameters or switch to more advanced models.
   - Project Delay: Strengthen team collaboration to ensure the project proceeds as planned.

## 7. Project Budget and Resources
   - Labor Costs: Voluntary contribution
   - Hardware Equipment: Servers, development computers, etc., self-provided
   - Large Model Expenses: Model token usage for image generation, provided by the Aminer Developer Platform for new users
   - Other Expenses: None

## 8. Project Communication and Collaboration
   - Adopt agile development methods, conduct iteration reviews once a week.
   - Use online collaboration tools (such as Tencent Meeting, WeChat Work, etc.) for communication and document sharing.

## 9. Project Deliverables
   - Executable software files
   - Project documents (including requirements analysis, design documents, test reports, etc.)
   - Source code and deployment scripts

## 10. Project Post-Support and Maintenance
   - Provide ongoing technical support and maintenance.
   - Regularly update software versions, fix known issues, and optimize performance.
